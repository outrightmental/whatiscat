Cats domesticated _themselves_.

## The Timeline:

### ~10,000 years ago:
- Humans store grain → rodents appear → wildcats show up.
- Humans tolerate cats because cats reduce pests.
- Cats stay because humans are:
  - warm,
  - predictable,
  - food-adjacent,
  - and extremely manipulable.

## Unlike Dogs

Unlike dogs, cats were never bred to obey. They formed a **mutual non-aggression pact**.

## What Cats Learned:

Over time, cats learned:
- Humans respond to eye contact
- Humans respond to sound patterns (meowing evolved _for us_)
- Humans will feed animals that look vaguely baby-like

## Cat logic:

> "These hairless primates control resources. I will allow them to live with me."
