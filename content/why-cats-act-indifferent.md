Cats express affection **sideways**, not directly.

## Why Cats Are Subtle:

### No Over-Display
In the wild, showing need is dangerous. Cats evolved to bond quietly.

### Subtle Signals
- **Slow blinks** = trust
- **Sitting near (not on) you** = companionship
- **Following you from room to room** = loyalty
- **Exposing belly _without_ asking for touch** = extreme trust

### Attachment Style
Cats form secure attachments similar to dogs and children—but they don't perform affection on command.

## If a cat ignores you but:
- checks where you are,
- sleeps nearby,
- greets you when you return,

…**that cat cares deeply**.

## Cat logic:

> "I do not need to prove affection. You are already inside my territory."
