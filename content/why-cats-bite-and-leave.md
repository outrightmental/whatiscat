This is not betrayal. It's communication.

## What's happening:

- Cats have a **low tolerance for sustained stimulation**.
- Petting builds pleasure → pleasure crosses threshold → overload.
- Bite is the warning. Leaving is the cooldown.

This is often called **petting-induced overstimulation**.

## Key clues you missed:

- Tail flicks
- Ears rotating sideways
- Skin rippling
- Sudden stillness

## The bite is:

- controlled
- brief
- not meant to injure

## Cat logic:

> "That was nice. Now it is too much. Goodbye."
