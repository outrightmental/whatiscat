Kneading is **muscle memory from infancy**, plus emotional regulation.

## Origins:

Kittens knead their mother's belly to stimulate milk flow. That motion gets permanently wired to **comfort and safety**.

## What it means as an adult:

- You = safe surface
- You = warm
- You = emotionally familiar
- Sometimes: mild territorial marking (scent glands in paws)

## When a cat kneads you:

- Their guard is down
- Their stress is low
- Their nervous system is self-soothing

If claws are involved, that's not aggression—it's **overconfidence**.

## Cat logic:

> "This feels like home."
