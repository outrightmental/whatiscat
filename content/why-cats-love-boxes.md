**Short version:** Boxes are safety, warmth, and tactical advantage in one cheap cardboard package.

## Long version:

### Predator + Prey Brain
Cats are ambush hunters _and_ vulnerable animals. A box gives cover on multiple sides with a single opening—perfect for watching without being seen.

### Stress Reduction
Studies show cats with access to boxes adapt faster and show lower stress hormones. The box isn't cute—it's therapy.

### Thermal Efficiency
Cardboard insulates. Cats like environments warmer than humans (about 86–97°F / 30–36°C).

### Control
In a box, _nothing_ can sneak up behind them. The world becomes legible.

## Cat logic:

> "I have reduced reality to one entrance. I am now safe."
