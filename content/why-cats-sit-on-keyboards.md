This is not accidental. It's a **multi-objective optimization problem**.

## Why Keyboards Are Irresistible:

### Heat
Laptops are warm.

### Height
Desks are prime territory.

### Scent
Your hands leave a strong, familiar smell on the keyboard.

### Attention Hijack
You're staring at the screen instead of _them_. Unacceptable.

### Territory Claim
Sitting = owning. This is cat law.

### Interactive Surface
Keyboards respond when stepped on, which convinces the cat it is a **high-leverage control surface**.

## Cat logic:

> "You appear absorbed. I will insert myself directly into the control system."
