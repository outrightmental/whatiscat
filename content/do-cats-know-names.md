Yes. They do. This has been tested.

## What cats learn:

- The sound pattern of their name
- That it predicts human attention or requests

## What they don't do:

Automatically respond.

Cats decide whether responding is worth it.

## You'll often see:

- Ear twitch
- Tail movement
- Eye shift

That's **recognition without compliance**.

---

Cats are **not disobedient**. They are **autonomous**.

---

## Cat logic:

> "I heard you. I decline."

---

## The Big Picture

These behaviors all point to the same truth:

Cats are:
- Emotionally rich
- Highly self-regulated
- Predator-calibrated
- Social, but on their own terms

They knead because you feel like safety.  
They chirp because instinct collides with reality.  
They bite because boundaries matter.  
They ignore their name because **free will matters more**.

You're not training a cat. You're negotiating with one.

And if they choose you? That's not obedience. That's trust.
