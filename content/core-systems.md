A cat is a **highly optimized chaos-powered biological machine**. Here's how the core systems work:

## 1. Locomotion & Physics Engine

- **Liquid Skeleton™**: Cats have a very flexible spine and a floating clavicle, allowing them to squeeze through any opening roughly the size of their skull.
- **Silent Mode**: Toe-walking (digitigrade stance) + padded paws = stealth movement.
- **Righting Reflex**: Inner-ear gyroscopes + spinal twist let cats reorient mid-air and usually land on their feet.

## 2. Sensory Array

- **Eyes**: Optimized for low light (excellent night vision, poor close-up focus).
- **Ears**: Independently swiveling radar dishes that triangulate sound.
- **Whiskers**: Precision proximity sensors that detect airflow, gaps, and mood.
- **Nose**: Smell > sight for identification and safety checks.

## 3. Power Management

- **Solar Charging**: Actively seeks sunbeams for passive recharging.
- **Sleep Cycle**: 12–16 hours/day to conserve energy for sudden 3 a.m. parkour.
- **Zoomies Protocol**: Random bursts of kinetic energy to prevent system stagnation.

## 4. Communication Interface

- **Meows**: Mostly for humans. Cats rarely meow at other cats.
- **Purring**: Multifunction signal (contentment, self-soothing, healing frequency).
- **Tail Language**: Mood indicator, balance aid, and mild threat system.
- **Slow Blink**: Non-verbal "I trust you / you are acceptable."

## 5. Behavior Algorithms

- **If I Fits, I Sits**: Spatial dominance subroutine.
- **Knock Object Off Surface**: Gravity testing + attention acquisition.
- **Ignore You Until You're Busy**: Core scheduling conflict feature.
- **Stare at Wall**: Possibly bug detection, possibly interdimensional monitoring.

## 6. Maintenance Requirements

- Food (must contain taurine)
- Clean litter box (or protest will occur)
- Vertical territory (cats think in **3D real estate**)
- Respect for personal boundaries (which may change without notice)

## In Summary

A cat is:
- A predator in a domestic shell
- A physics exploit with fur
- Emotionally independent but socially bonded
- Half roommate, half ancient deity
