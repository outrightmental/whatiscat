These offerings are not mistakes. They are **intentional social behavior**.

## What's happening:

- Cats are instinctive hunters.
- You are part of their social unit.
- In cat culture, **sharing food = care + status**.

## Two Main Theories

Both can be true:

### 1. Teaching Behavior
Your cat believes you are a _terrible hunter_.  
The gift is a lesson.

> "Observe. This is how one mouse."

### 2. Provisioning the Colony
You are considered part of the group.  
The hunt was successful.  
Distribution follows.

If the gift is a toy instead of a corpse, that's the **domesticated, HR-approved version**.

## Cat logic:

> "I have contributed. You are welcome."
