Cats are not being rude. They are being **extremely punctual**.

## Reasons:

### Crepuscular Biology
Cats are wired to be active at dawn and dusk.

### Food Association
If you've _ever_ fed them shortly after waking up, congratulations—you trained them.

### Routine Integrity
Cats love schedules. Your alarm is a _suggestion_. Their internal clock is law.

### Vulnerability Check
Sleep = defenseless. Dawn is when the group re-synchronizes.

They are not waking _you_.  
They are waking **the household**.

## Cat logic:

> "The day has begun. Please proceed."
