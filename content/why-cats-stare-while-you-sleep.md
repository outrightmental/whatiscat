This one feels ominous, but it's mostly affectionate… mostly.

## Possible reasons:

### Protection
You are unconscious. The cat is awake. Someone must keep watch.

### Bond Monitoring
Cats check on members of their social group.

### Curiosity
You make strange noises. Your breathing changes. You twitch.

### Ownership Audit
Just confirming you're still there.

They are not plotting.  
(Usually.)

If they sit near your head or chest, that's **high trust**.

## Cat logic:

> "You are vulnerable. I will supervise."
