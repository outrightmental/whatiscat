Yes.  
But not in a cruel way.

## How Cats Think About Ownership

Cats do **not** think of ownership like humans do. They think in terms of **territory + relationships**.

### Here's how you rank:

- You are **mobile furniture** ✔
- You are **resource controller** ✔
- You are **social ally** ✔
- You are **inside their territory** ✔

## What Cats Don't Think

Cats don't think:
> "I belong to this human."

They think:
> "This human belongs _here_."

Which is better.

## Signs you are "owned":

- The cat sits on you without permission
- The cat interrupts your activities
- The cat chooses you over empty furniture
- The cat acts offended when you move

---

## Cat logic:

> "I allow you to participate in my environment."

## Final Truth

Your cat:
- Brings gifts because it sees you as family (or incompetent)
- Wakes you because mornings are non-negotiable
- Watches you sleep because you matter
- "Owns" you because you are part of its world

Cats don't worship humans.  
They **integrate** us.

And once you're integrated, you're in for life.
