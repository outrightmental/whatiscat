That rapid _ek-ek-ek_ sound is called **chattering**.

No one knows for sure—but the best explanations converge:

## Three Theories:

### 1. Frustrated Predation
The hunting sequence is activated but blocked by glass.

### 2. Kill-Bite Rehearsal
The jaw motion matches the precise bite cats use to sever spinal cords.

### 3. Excitement Overflow
Their brain is firing "HUNT" faster than their body can act.
